# Tic Tac Toe

This project was developed using Angluar.js and Nebular

## Reason for Project

I have a angular development opportunity coming up soon and wanted to do a crash course. I found
the fireship beginners course to get a quick understanding of how angular worked compared to react

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
